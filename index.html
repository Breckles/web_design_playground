        Dear Art Teacher,
      </p>
      <p>
        Please excuse <span class="blank person">person in room</span> for being
        late for your <span class="blank adjective">adjective</span> art class. It's
        my fault. I feel <span class="blank adjective">adjective</span> <span class="blank person">same person in
          room</span> was up until the <span class="blank adjective">adjective</span> hours of the morning finishing
        his/her <span class="blank adjective">adjective</span>
        project. Just as we were going out the <span class="blank
        adjective">adjective</span> door, I saw that his/her only pair of <span class="blank pluralNoun">nouns</span>
        had a
        <span class="blank singleNoun">noun</span>
        in them. He/she needed to change! Then it took me an hour to find my <span class="blank pluralNoun">nouns</span>
        to
        drive
        him/her to school that morning
        since, <span class="blank person">same person in room</span> missed the
        <span class="blank singleNoun">noun</span>.
